# fecgsyn-anatomic-models

This repository contains pre-processed anatomic models for the [fecgsyn](http://fernandoandreotti.github.io/fecgsyn/index.html) toolbox. These models are a derivative of the Victoria-TiGroFetus-32weeks models created by the [FEMONUM project](http://femonum.telecom-paristech.fr/index.html) used under [CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 FR](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/fr/). The original models can be obtained by [registering](http://femonum.telecom-paristech.fr/download.html) with the FEMONUM project.

# Usage

To use these models, follow the steps listed below:
